## ðŸ”´About
**Nightwalkers** is a 2D action platformer game where Luna, the main character, is one of the nightwalkers who helps the people of Onmyo City from the disturbances caused by thugs in the city.

Luna, aided by her katana-shaped power, can parry enemies and defeat the foes she faces. After successfully parrying enemies with her katana, Luna will gain active skills, including HP regeneration or counterattack.

So get ready to walk the night with us!
